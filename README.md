    *Community-driven legal/standards research workspace.*

    This repository is configured with sensible defaults for governance, CI, labeling, projects, and release drafting.    Automation is designed for both **humans** and **AI agents**.

    ## Quick start
    - Fork or branch from `master`.
    - Use **conventional commits** (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`...).
    - Open a PR; the Semantic PR check will validate the title.
    - Label issues/PRs with `status/*`, `priority/*`, and `area/*` when relevant.

    ## Contributing (humans & AI agents)
