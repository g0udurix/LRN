    # Contributing Guide

    Welcome! This project supports contributions by both **humans** and **AI agents**.

    ## Principles
    - Incremental, reviewable changes
    - Reproducibility and traceability (issues link to sources; PRs link to issues)
    - Community safety and respect (see Code of Conduct)

    ## Workflow
    1. **Open / find an issue** and confirm scope. Use labels: `status/Todo`, `priority/P*`, `area/*`.
    2. **Create a branch**: `type/short-topic` (e.g., `feat/history-crawl`).
    3. **Commit with conventional commits**: `feat: add extractor for XY`.
    4. **PR checklist** (auto-included):
       - [ ] Title follows conventional commits
       - [ ] Linked issue & milestone
       - [ ] Labels added (`status/*`, `priority/*`, `area/*`)
       - [ ] Updated docs and CHANGELOG if user-facing
    5. **Reviews**: be kind, specific, and actionable; prefer follow-ups over scope creep.

    ## AI Contributor Guidance
    - Identify yourself in PR description: "This change was prepared by an AI agent".
    - Only modify files you are asked to. If something is ambiguous, open an issue first.
    - Provide a minimal, passing CI change; include sample data if needed.
    - Keep explanations concise; reference sources with links when possible.

    ## Local setup
    - Python 3.10+
    - `gh` CLI (optional) for milestone/branch-protection helpers
