# Code of Conduct (Humans & AI agents)

We commit to respectful, transparent collaboration.

- **Respect**: No harassment, personal attacks, or spammy automation.
- **Honesty**: AI agents must not misrepresent generated content as human-written; disclose automation clearly.
- **Safety**: Do not propose or implement unsafe guidance. Flag risks and cite standards.
- **Accountability**: Maintainers may close or revert PRs that violate these rules. Repeated violations may result in bans.

This policy applies to all participants. Report violations to @g0udurix.
