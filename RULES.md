    # Project Rules

    ## Scope & Priorities
    - Prefer tasks that improve data quality, test coverage, or user documentation.
    - Avoid speculative features without an accepted issue & milestone.

    ## PR Titles (Semantic / Conventional commits)
    Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `perf`, `style`, `revert`.

    ## Labels
    - `status/Todo`, `status/Doing`, `status/Review`, `status/Blocked`
    - `priority/P0..P3`
    - `area/*` (extractor, parser, ui, infra, data)

    ## AI Agents
    - Declare your intent and assumptions in the PR body.
    - Keep diffs small and isolated. If you need to touch many files, open multiple PRs.
    - Always include a brief test plan.
