# Issue: Edmonton Facade/Window Cleaning Bylaw Sources

## Summary
No authoritative URL has been located for Edmonton-specific facade/window
cleaning bylaws (e.g., rooftop fall protection, rope access). Municipal bylaw
repository requires interactive navigation and has no obvious direct PDF links.

## Next Steps
1. Contact City of Edmonton or search their open-data portal for relevant bylaws.
2. Once URLs are confirmed, create `docs/corpus/manifests/edmonton.json` and begin
   monitoring.
