# Issue: City of Ottawa Property Standards / Rope Access Bylaws

## Summary
Attempts to locate official PDFs for Ottawa property standards or construction
safety bylaws (relevant to window cleaning/fall protection) are unresolved.
External search results point to HTML summaries without downloadable versions.

## Next Steps
1. Investigate Ottawa's bylaw library or contact the city clerk for direct PDF
   links.
2. Once identified, add `docs/corpus/manifests/ottawa.json` and wire into the
   monitoring workflow.
