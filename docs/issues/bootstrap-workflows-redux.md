# Issue: Rebuild Governance Runner & Workflow Bootstrap

## Summary
Legacy branch `chore/bootstrap-workflows` attempted to introduce automation helpers
(`runner.py`, `updatecodebase.py`, GitHub workflow templates, label sync, release
 drafter, etc.) but the branch includes thousands of generated artifacts
(`Legisquebec originals/`, `output/`, `.DS_Store`, SQLite dumps) that cannot be merged.
The `runner.py` in that branch is also a prose guide rather than an executable,
so the documented command `python runner.py --apply --self-test` is currently broken on
`master`.

## Required Work
1. Recreate a minimal `runner.py` CLI that:
   - Applies governance defaults (labels, issue templates, workflows) from a
     reproducible source tree; and
   - Provides `--apply` and `--self-test` actions referenced in docs.
2. Restore only the necessary GitHub workflow/template updates (Release Drafter,
   labels sync, project sync, semantic PR, auto-milestone) without committing
   any generated content.
3. Update `.gitignore` to prevent `Legisquebec originals/`, `output/`, SQLite DBs,
   and `.DS_Store` from being tracked; verify the clean tree in CI.
4. Document the runner usage in `README.md` and `PLAN.md` once the CLI is rebuilt.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Branch merges cleanly with zero autogenerated artifacts.
- `python runner.py --apply --self-test` executes successfully in CI and locally.
- Docs link to the executable runner and list prerequisites (e.g., GitHub PAT for
  label/project sync).

## Current Work (2025-09-18)
- [`runner.py`](/runner.py) scaffolded with `--apply` / `--self-test` options that walk `governance/templates/`.
- Template bundle lives under `governance/templates/` (CI workflow + issue templates) mirroring current defaults.
- Added pytest coverage (`tests/test_runner_cli.py`) to exercise discovery, mismatch detection, dry-run, and apply logic.
- Documentation updates pending once CLI behaviour is validated (`README.md`, `PLAN.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`).
