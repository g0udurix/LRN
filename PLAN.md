# LRN Project Plan

## Goal
Deliver a dependable Python extractor that:
- isolates the LegisQuÃ©bec inner XHTML fragment for every instrument;
- enriches annex links with Markdown sidecars and provenance metadata;
- captures version history snapshots with deterministic file layouts; and
- remains reproducible through offline fixtures and automated tests.

## Current Status
- CLI orchestrates mirror â†’ extract â†’ annex â†’ history flows (`lrn/cli.py`, `lrn/history.py`).
- Offline pytest suite exercises extraction, annex placeholders, and history crawling.
- GitHub project board (Project 3) tracks Phase 0 work; issues #11â€“#19 form the execution backlog.

## Phase 0 (Baseline)
1. **Unify default branch** (#19) â€“ âœ… merged & pushed; master is canonical.
2. **Modularize extractor core** (#11) â€“ âœ… modules landed (`lrn/extract.py`, `lrn/annex.py`, `lrn/history.py`).
3. **Harden annex pipeline** (#12) â€“ âœ… retries/size caps + typed records.
4. **Ship history sidecars** (#13) â€“ âœ… structured snapshots & injection warnings.
5. **Fix CLI toggles** (#14) â€“ âœ… `--no-annex-pdf-to-md` / `--no-history-sidecars` supported.
6. **Expand regression coverage** (#15) â€“ âœ… annex/history/RC-path fixtures in pytest.
7. **Add pytest CI workflow** (#16) â€“ âœ… GitHub Actions matrix (3.10/3.11) in place.
8. **Sync documentation** (#17) â€“ ðŸš§ updating README/AGENTS to reflect new architecture.

## Principles & Constraints
- Never commit fetched HTML, snapshots, or SQLite artifacts; all outputs must be reproducible locally.
- Keep HTML untouched aside from additive enrichment; no destructive rewriting of the fragment.
- Treat annex/history network failures as warningsâ€”report but continue extraction.
- Maintain bilingual parity (FR + EN) for discovery, extraction, and tests.

## Coordination
- Use labels `status/*`, `priority/*`, and `area/extractor` consistently.
- Run `python -m pytest` before every PR; for governance changes also run `python runner.py --apply --self-test`.
- Track progress and blockers in Project 3; move cards as issues transition from Todo â†’ Doing â†’ Review â†’ Done.

## Upcoming (Post Phase 0)
- Refine module boundaries (`lrn/extract.py`, `lrn/annex.py`, `lrn/persist.py`) for reuse by future services.
- Explore structured persistence (SQLite or search index) once the extractor API stabilizes.
- Extend fixtures to cover OCR/scan edge cases before enabling `--ocr` flows.
